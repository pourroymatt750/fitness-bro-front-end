This is an app that allows a user to improve their fitness by giving them the ability to track both their meals and their workouts. This app has two API's, one that allows a user to look up the nutrition value of their meals (calories, protein, ect) and another API that allows a user to look up different types of workouts for different body parts the user wishes to workout. This is a full-stack MERN application consisting of mostly React.js for the front-end user-interface with Monggose and MongoDB being primarily used for the back-end.
